👋 Hi, I'm Ashley 
🔍 About Me
I'm a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights, solving puzzles with data, and transforming numbers into meaningful stories. 
With 6+ years in educational data analysis, I specialize in SQL, Excel, and Tableau to drive decision-making and improve student outcomes.

Beyond data, I'm deeply interested in Astrology and its intersections with psychology and 
spirituality—exploring how these frameworks help with self-reflection, 
personal growth, and even statistical analysis (because who doesn't love finding patterns in human behavior? 😉).

💡 Why I Love Data
For me, data is like a puzzle—investigating trends and patterns to connect the dots and reveal deeper insights. 
Whether it’s tracking student progress or analyzing business metrics, I enjoy piecing together information to create a data-driven narrative that leads to impactful decisions.

🛠️ Favorite Tools
🔹 Excel – Love using fun functions to aggregate data and pull in live data insights.
🔹 SQL – The best for working with large datasets, cleaning, aggregating, and uniting multiple sources (especially for analyzing student performance).
🔹 Tableau – Perfect for building intuitive dashboards that make complex data easy to understand

🔎 My Approach to Data Problems
When tackling a dataset, I start by asking:
✅ What are 4-5 goals/insights I need to obtain from my data?
✅ What is the best tool to use to obtain insights?
✅ How will I use this data to improve outcomes?
✅ What external factors might be influencing the data?

From there, I break down the information to identify patterns, struggles, or opportunities for improvement—whether it's student success, business efficiency, or process optimization. 
Even small variables, like classroom settings or teacher engagement, can impact data, and finding these insights helps drive better strategies and interventions.
